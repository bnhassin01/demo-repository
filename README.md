# Welcome to your organization's [demo respository](https://github.com/bnhassin01/demo-repository/tree/bnhassin-patch-1#welcome-to-your-organizations-demo-respository-1)

This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency ðŸ˜Ž
